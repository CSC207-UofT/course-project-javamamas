## Specification

Our goal for the course project is to create a Monopoly game. In this program, we will allow up to 4 players which can all play from the same computer. Each player will have a character name and person balance (amount of money they have) stored. Throughout the game, players can buy properties - which we will call buyable tiles, and when they buy a whole lot (all properties of the same color), they can also start buying houses or hotels which increase the property value. Another feature of the program is that players will have to pay rent when they land on a tile that is not in their ownership, or if that tile is still on the market they have the option to buy that property. Additionally, there will be tiles which are not buyable, and rather describe a task or consequence that the player must abide to. Finally, there will be the tiles which have actions of their own, such as the starting tile which gives a player $200 upon passing, the go to jail tile, and the jail tile which holds player.

The program will control which players own each buyable tile, and determine whether or not players have enough funds to purchase a tile when prompted to do so. Additionally, the program will keep track of the number of tiles sold and remaining at all points in the game, as well as the funds of each player. The game will end when all players are bankrupt except one, or when all properties are sold and declares the person with the highest net-worth as the winner.
